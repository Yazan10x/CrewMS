# CrewMS

Is a system that manages crews on long distance explorations. CrewMS prompts all crew members to fill in a daily check-in, which asks the crew members information about their physical, emotional, and mental health. Each check-in is checked using an AI to flag crew members that may be facing health issues. All crew members also have the ability to report incidents anonymously, which will temporarily suspend the accused crew member(s).
